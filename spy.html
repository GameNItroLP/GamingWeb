<h2>pyParty is a competitive espionage game about human <br>behavior, performance, perception, and deception. While most spy <br>games have you machine-gunning stuff, blowing things up, and <br>driving fast, SpyParty has you hide in plain sight, blend <br>into a high-society cocktail party, deceive your opponent, <br>and detect subtle behavioral tells to achieve your <br>objectives and not get shot. Finally you can be like the suave <br>and confident spies you find in films or books, risking it <br>all by doing the final mission right in front of the sniper <br>as the clock runs out! There are plenty of games that <br>explore being a super-powered commando with an infinite supply <br>of ammunition and no brains; SpyParty is a new and quite <br>different game about the more interesting, deeper, and more <br>subtle aspects of being a spy.<br>
