			<h2>After years of tireless explorations, brave Vikings have discovered a new land filled with mystery, danger and riches: Northgard.

The boldest Northmen have set sail to explore and conquer these new shores, bring fame to their Clan and write history through conquest, trading, or devotion to the Gods.

That is, if they can survive the dire wolves and undead warriors roaming the land, befriend or defeat the giants, and survive the harshest winters ever witnessed in the North.

THE STORY MODE: RIG’S SAGA

The Viking High King is murdered and his REGAL HORN is stolen by a man named HAGEN. This event kickstarts a saga that will take RIG, his son and heir accompanied by his right-hand man BRAND through the new continent of NORTHGARD, where he will make new friends and foes and discover a much greater threat than HAGEN, and the reasons behind his father’s assassination.
