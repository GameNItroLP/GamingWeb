				Automation Empire is a simulation / management game all about efficiency and expansion. Start with nothing, and build up a massive interconnected industrial network of factories and machines. Economical transportation of resources will be essential to your success as an automation-engineer. Utilize every tool you have access to, including mine carts, drones. trucks, trains, and cargo rockets. Employ your ingenuity and creativity to plan out an efficient logistics network of machines to form a mechanical superorganism of production.
DESIGN COMPLEX SYSTEMS
Harness your creativity to engineer a beautiful machine of clockwork precision. Start with basic "A to B" systems utilizing simple delivery drones, but later, expand the complexity of your transportation-line as you construct an interwoven mesh of tracks in order to allocate all of your resources exactly where they need to go.
