<h2><br>Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey is a third-person open world survival game where you Explore, Expand, and Evolve to <br>
advance your clan to the next generation in this exhilarating new adventure from the creator of Assassin’s Creed.<br>

Embark on the most incredible odyssey known to humankind: human evolution. Spanning from 10 million to 2 million years ago,<br>
 begin your journey, before us, in Neogene period Africa. Explore a beautiful yet ruthless world, from swinging through tree <br>
 branches in the jungle to stalking prey across the golden savannah grasslands. Decide what attributes to learn and hone in<br>
 order to pass down knowledge to future generations, from crafting tools to enhancing evasive tactics against predators.<br>
 Just like real life, make sure to eat, drink, and sleep to stay alive and have the energy to face any danger that may come your way.<br>
 

Grow your clan and find strength in numbers as you progress through critical evolutionary stages of human evolution. <br>
Your choices will write your clan’s story and determine if you can survive your evolution.<br>
