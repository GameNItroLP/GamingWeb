<h2><br>In Stonehearth, you pioneer a living world full of warmth, heroism, and mystery.<br>
 Help a small group of settlers build a home for themselves in a forgotten land. You’ll need <br>
 to establish a food supply, build shelter, defend your people, monitor their moods, and find a <br>
 way to grow and expand, facing challenges at every step. <br>

Starting from procedurally generated terrain with dynamic AI encounters, <br>
Stonehearth combines community management and combat with infinite building possibilities. <br>
It’s designed to be moddable at every level, from your city to the people and creatures inhabiting <br>
the world, and will ship with the tools and documentation for you to add your own customizations to the game,<br>
 and share them with friends.	<br>
