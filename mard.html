<h2>Mard is an indie horror game developed and published by Black Curtain Studio.  Your job is to be a detective and you decide to<br>
 take time off work to go out to your dad’s log cabin in the wilderness.  Your character drives to the cabin with his trusty dog Speck, <br>
 a German Shorthaired Pointer, who will accompany you throughout your journey.  <br>

 

When you arrive at the cabin you immediately realize that something has gone terribly wrong.  <br>
Your father is missing. In an effort to find out what happened to your father you search for clues and evidence around the house. <br>
 The evidence will lead you and your dog Speck onto a scary adventure.<br>

 

In order to survive and find your father your character must brave the elements and take advantage of the<br>
 resources, he has around him.  Nature can be dangerous so don’t get lost in the forest, and don’t wander out<br>
 of the cabin at night! Speck can help you get around obstacles and avoid enemies along the way. <br>
 All in an effort to discover the mystery of what happened to your father.<br>
