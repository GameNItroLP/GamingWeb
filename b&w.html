<h2><br>In thisstrategy game, you reprise your role as a powerful deity in search of a following and return to<br>
 the once idyllic world of Eden, where the discovery of weaponry and warfare has tainted the beautiful landscape. <br>
 With the help of your giganticCreature that you raise from infancy, you must earn the respect and worship of the natives.<br>
 How you choose to do that,, whether through nurturing them or terrorizing them is up to you.<br>

Once there were many gods - all depending on theworship of humans to survive. <br>
 As their following increased, they grew in strength, and as their battle for control intensified,<br>
 destruction became second nature to the people of Eden.  This was chronicled in the past and has since<br>
 passedinto legend. But after the devastation came peace.  Without hardship, people stopped needing gods<br>
 and the gods simply disappeared.  And without gods, life continued.<br>
While you've slumbered, the path to evil has become even moreenticing.<br>

  Warriors have been born, ever more fearsome weaponry has been developed, and the once idyllic land of Eden<br>
  is teetering on the brink.  The Greek people - your people - form the final barrier to total Aztec domination. Now a simple,<br>
  desperate prayer has brought you back and you must follow your conscience once more.  Will you establish secure and majestic <br>
  environments that will become the envy of peoples across the land or will your cities become evil citadels of aggressionwith <br>
  the sole purpose of supporting your war machine?  Will you devote all your powers to enriching your people's lives or will you<br>
  watch as they march to their deaths?  This time it really matters,<br>
	<br>
