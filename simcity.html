<h2>Show the world what a real mayor can do! In SimCity you’ll take control of a living, breathing town, full of citizens who have their own identities and ideas. Setting up your city is deceptively simple; the real challenge—and the real fun—comes from managing the complex, robust environment you’ve created
<br><br>The hills are alive: Each Sim in your town is a unique individual, and you can view their needs and desires at any time. Each change you make affects the entire ecosystem, so plan carefully!
City controls: Intuitive tools make placing roads and buildings as easy as clicking and dragging. The nice, clean interface gives you as much or as little information as you need to get things done.
